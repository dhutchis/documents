# Dylan's Documents

Here lie the deeds of Dylan Hutchison,
as listed in his [Curriculum Vitae](https://github.com/dhutchis/dhutchis-cv/raw/master/dhutchis-cv.pdf) (*read this for the full list of Dylan's works*).

I place here posters and presentations that are not hosted elsewhere on the Internet, such as [Arxiv](https://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Hutchison_D/0/1/0/all/0/1) and project repositories.
